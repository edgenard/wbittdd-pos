Test Lists:
  Can receive input string and outputs price or no price:
    - `barcode_scan(input)` method does not return @done
    - call price_output to get input` @done
    - "12345/n" -> "$123.45" @done
    - "23456" -> "$234.56" @done
    - "34567/r" -> "$678.90" @done
    - "12345/n/r" -> "$123.45" @done
    - " 12345/n" -> "$123.45" @done
    - "/n" -> "/n is Invalid Input" @done
    - " /n" ->"/n Invalid Input" @done
    - "/r" -> "/r Invalid Input" @done
    - " /r" -> "/r Invalid Input" @done
    - "45678" -> "45678 Not found" @done
    - "123/n" -> "Invalid Input must be exactly five digits @done
    - "567890" -> Invalid Input must be exactly 5 digits @done
    - "1" -> "Invalid @done
Constraints:
    - Introduce Whole Value objects without specifying the underlying value
    - Answer:
        - How many tests can you write without needing to specify a value for the underlying Barcode?
        - Which feature or test forces you to introduce a value property inside the Barcode?
        - Which code, if any, does the Barcode class attract? How does this change the overall design of the system?
        - What if you do the same thing with Price?
